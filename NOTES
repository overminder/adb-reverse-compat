# Our Implementation

Basically we rely on `adb forward` for a bidirection communication.

- Client

  Runs on the device. Firstly accepts an initial TCP
  connection (`the pipe`) from the host through adb forward, then starts
  accepting device TCP connections (`reverse forwarded connections`).

- Server

  Runs on the host. Firstly connects to the client via `adb forward`, then
  starts handling forwarded TCP requests from the client.
